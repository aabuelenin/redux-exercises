# A Simple Pure Redux App

In this exercise you will look at Redux only, without any React or even a UI (apart from a terminal console).

1. Clone this repo, install and run it: <https://github.com/petermunro/redux-only>

1. Now look through the source file `src/index.js`, and answer:

  1. What does the state object look like?
  1. How is the store created?
  1. How can an app be informed about updates to the store?
  1. When informed, how does an app retrieve the store's state?
  1. How are actions dispatched?
  1. What _is_ an action?
  1. What happens to the action defined, once dispatched?
  1. How is the store changed after the action has been dispatched?

1. Try dispatching a further action, containing your own data, and view the store's state to verify it has been updated as you expect.
